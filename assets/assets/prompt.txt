How can I create a Flutter widget that accepts the following input parameters: imageName, itt, ng, transferValue, and torque? The widget should display a .png image, which is an XY graph, and draw lines over it based on the input values. The lines represent either X or Y values, where transferValue is mapped to the horizontal (Y) axis, and the other inputs (itt, ng, torque) are mapped to the vertical (X) axis. Each line should have its corresponding value as a label.

The widget should also scale the input values according to the graph. should be coded two points for each escale like: transferValue=0 represents %of height from botton of image; transferValue=50 represents %-a of height from bottom wwith a linear change inside and outside those two references. same for the other on % of width. This widget will be placed on a new page with appbar and return button and should maximize the group size. The page should support pinch-to-zoom functionality, and the drawing should adjust to the new viewport size, ensuring that the lines remain accurately placed.

The vertical lines should start from the horizontal line and extend upwards. The horizontal line should end at the last vertical line. Each line should have a unique color, and the value label should be displayed next to the corresponding line, along it.
